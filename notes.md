## 1. General Outline

### Phase 1: Setup and Argument Parsing
- Parse command-line arguments (`-v`, `-?`, target address/hostname)
- Validate IPv4 addresses or hostnames
- Use `getaddrinfo()` for hostname resolution

### Phase 2: Socket Creation and Configuration
- Create raw ICMP socket (`socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP)`)
- Set socket options with `setsockopt()` (SO_RCVTIMEO, etc.)
- Handle privilege requirements (raw sockets need root/capabilities)

### Phase 3: ICMP Packet Construction
- Build ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8, code 0)
- Implement checksum calculation
- Add sequence numbers and identifiers
- Use `getpid()` for unique identification

### Phase 4: Main Loop
- Send packets using `sendto()`
- Receive replies using `recvmsg()`
- Handle timeouts and errors
- Parse ICMP replies and extract relevant data

### Phase 5: Statistics and Output
- Calculate RTT (Round Trip Time)
- Track packet loss
- Display results in ping format
- Handle verbose mode (`-v`) for detailed output

### Phase 6: Signal Handling
- Use `signal()` to handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
- Display final statistics on exit
- Clean shutdown with `exit()`


Breakdown:
- Understanding ICMP protocol and raw sockets: 3-8 hours
- Basic implementation (send/receive): 8-15 hours
- Error handling and edge cases: 4-10 hours
- Testing and debugging: 5-15 hours
- Code cleanup and optimization: 2-5 hours

## 2. Design Flexibility for Additional Flags

Initial design choices will **significantly impact** future extensibility.

### Recommended Architecture:

```c
typedef struct s_ping_config {
    char            *target;
    struct sockaddr_in dest_addr;
    int             verbose;
    int             flood;          // -f
    int             preload;        // -l
    int             numeric;        // -n
    int             timeout;        // -w
    int             deadline;       // -W
    char            *pattern;       // -p
    int             bypass_routing; // -r
    int             packet_size;    // -s
    int             tos;           // -T
    int             ttl;           // --ttl
    int             ip_timestamp;  // --ip-timestamp
    // ... other flags
} t_ping_config;

typedef struct s_ping_stats {
    int transmitted;
    int received;
    int errors;
    double min_rtt;
    double max_rtt;
    double sum_rtt;
    // ... other stats
} t_ping_stats;
```

### Key Design Principles:

1. **Modular Functions**: Separate packet creation, sending, receiving, and parsing
2. **Configuration Structure**: Centralize all options in a config struct
3. **Flexible Packet Builder**: Design packet construction to handle variable sizes and options
4. **Extensible Parser**: Use function pointers or switch statements for different packet types
5. **Clean Interfaces**: Abstract socket operations for easy modification

### Future Flag Considerations:

- **`-f` (flood)**: Requires timing modifications and rate limiting
- **`-l` (preload)**: Needs packet queue management
- **`-p` (pattern)**: Requires flexible payload generation
- **`-s` (size)**: Impacts packet allocation and validation
- **`--ttl`**: Needs IP header manipulation via socket options

If you design with a clean separation of concerns from the start, adding these flags later should only require:
- Extending the config structure
- Adding new command-line parsing cases
- Implementing specific flag logic without major refactoring

The key is to avoid hardcoding values and to make your packet construction and transmission functions parameter-driven rather than assumption-based.

### NOTES

ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
Itâ€™s a network layer protocol (part of the IP suite, defined in RFC 792).
Its job is to send control messages and error reporting between devices.
Unlike TCP or UDP, ICMP is not used to carry "user data," but rather to send information about the health of the network.


ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s in a ping packet?

A complete ICMP packet looks like this:
[ IP header ] + [ ICMP header ] + [ ICMP payload ]
IP header â†’ 20 bytes (not counted in ping -s size)
ICMP header â†’ 8 bytes (type, code, checksum, id, seq)
ICMP payload â†’ variable size (this is what packet_size controls)


The ping command implements the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request/reply mechanism. Here's how it works under the hood:

## Core Mechanism

Ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target host and waits for ICMP Echo Reply packets back. It measures the round-trip time (RTT) and reports packet loss statistics.

## Implementation Details

**Socket Creation**
You'll need a raw socket with `SOCK_RAW` and `IPPROTO_ICMP`. This requires root privileges since you're crafting packets at the IP level:
```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP);
```

**ICMP Packet Structure**
The ICMP header has this structure:
- Type (8 bits): 8 for Echo Request, 0 for Echo Reply
- Code (8 bits): 0 for echo messages  
- Checksum (16 bits): Covers ICMP header and data
- Identifier (16 bits): Usually process ID to match requests/replies
- Sequence Number (16 bits): Incremented for each packet sent

**Checksum Calculation**
You must calculate the Internet checksum over the entire ICMP packet. Set checksum field to 0 first, then compute the 16-bit one's complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header and data.

**Timing Mechanism**
Before sending each packet, record a timestamp (usually in the data payload). When you receive a reply, compare with the current time to calculate RTT. Use `gettimeofday()` or similar for microsecond precision.

**Send/Receive Loop**
The basic flow is:
1. Construct ICMP Echo Request with incremented sequence number
2. Send packet using `sendto()`
3. Use `select()` or `poll()` with timeout to wait for reply
4. Receive with `recvfrom()` 
5. Parse received packet to extract ICMP reply and validate it matches your request
6. Calculate and display RTT
7. Wait 1 second (default interval) and repeat

**IP Header Handling**
When you receive packets on a raw ICMP socket, you get the full IP packet. You'll need to parse the IP header to find the ICMP portion. The IP header length varies (typically 20 bytes but can be longer with options).

**Error Handling**
Handle various ICMP error types that might come back instead of echo replies, like Destination Unreachable (type 3) or Time Exceeded (type 11).

The key challenges in your C implementation will be proper checksum calculation, handling the raw socket mechanics, and parsing the received packets correctly to extract timing information.
